# Rotstim Clicker

Rotstim Clicker is a raw, browser-based clicker game where your brain slowly melts into pure stimulation. Click the big button to earn **Stimulation Points**, then spend those points on upgrades that help you rot even faster. It's chaotic, addictive, and built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — no libraries, no frameworks.
This is a solo project designed to simulate that dopamine-rush feedback loop in the dumbest smartest way possible.

##  What It Does
- Click to earn **Stimulation Points**
- Buy upgrades to boost your points per click or generate points automatically
- Save your progress using your browser (via `localStorage`)
- Simple, modular, and totally expandable  more features will be soon added
---
##  Tech Stack
- **HTML** – structure
- **CSS** – styling, responsive layout
- **JavaScript** – logic and interactivity (vanilla only)
- **localStorage API** – saves your progress between sessions
No React. No jQuery. No external libraries. Just brain juice and raw JS.

## Save System
Your progress is saved in your browser using `localStorage`. Come back later and continue where you left off.
## In Progress
This project is still evolving. Coming soon:
- Prestige / Rebirth system
- Audio feedback and click sounds
- Visual effects: floating numbers, button pulses
- Better shop and upgrade scaling
- Optional theme system and stats
- Potential mobile optimization
## Who Made This?
This was built and is managed by me Chitraksh Kataria. This was built from scratch as a solo learning project, powered by caffeine and the desire to rot productively.
If you want to fork it, remix it, or build on top of it go wild.

## License
